# Sorting-Hat

Sorting-Hat is a "Harry Potter" style software that asks the user a series of questions and based upon those answers determines which "house" the user is to be sorted into.

The program also lists output details of the calculations used and final percentage weights for each choice of house.

Sorting-Hat was done as a graphical program written entirely in Java.
